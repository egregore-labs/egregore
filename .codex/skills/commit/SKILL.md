# Egregore commit Adapter

This is fallback coverage for a long-tail Egregore workflow that has not been
ported to a hand-written Codex-native skill yet.

Use the project shell and filesystem directly. Do not invoke Claude Code
commands. Translate interactive choices to structured Codex question tooling
when it is available; otherwise render compact numbered choices with an
`Other:` option and wait for the user.

1. Read `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` for the workflow details.
2. Run the referenced `bin/` scripts directly from Codex.
3. Treat graph and publish steps as best-effort unless that workflow explicitly
   says they are required.
4. For every external notification, follow
   `.claude/context/notification-consent.md`: plan without sending, then show
   a separate exact Send / Edit / Cancel checkpoint. Never infer notification
   consent from the workflow request or a batch approval.
5. Keep local-mode behavior filesystem-first and avoid graph or notification
   calls when `egregore.json` declares `"mode": "local"`.
6. Never call the deprecated `egregore-handoff` CLI for Egregore project
   handoffs.
